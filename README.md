This code is my final project for AP Computer Science class in high school

What does this code do?
	This code is split into client and server side. What it basically does is that it will allow users to input the genres they want to analyze of movies. Specifically, the correlation between the movie’s budget and the movie’s revenue. For example, the user can choose two genres or analyze all the movies in general. Furthermore, the code will output a graph as long as the results of the analysis.
